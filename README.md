trace_class
===========

Trace classifier. This program is basically useless to anyone but few people that use program traces in one specific format. The program reads the trace from a gzipped trace file and computes some basic statistics. Feature vectors are then stored in an sqlite database.

Requires sqlite3, and zlib to compile.
